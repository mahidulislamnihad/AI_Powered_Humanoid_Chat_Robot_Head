# ABROB – AI-Powered Humanoid Chat Robot  
**Python • FFT Audio Processing • Vision Model • Arduino • I2C • PCA9685 Servo Control**

ABROB ( AI-Powered Humanoid Chat Robot) is a humanoid robot head prototype capable of **listening**, **seeing**, and **reacting** through audio and vision-driven behavior. It combines Python-based perception modules with Arduino-based servo actuation to simulate natural human-like interactions.

> ⚠ **Note:** Source code is intentionally omitted.  
This project is under active academic research and paper preparation.  
The repo contains architecture, project workflow, system documentation, and prototype images.

## 🧠 System Overview

The robot is divided into four core modules:

### 1️. **Audio Perception Module**
- Dual microphone input  
- FFT-based DOA (Direction-of-Arrival)  
- RMS thresholding  

### 2. **Vision Module**
- Face detection  
- Eye tracking communication engaged person in multiple person scenario   
- Stabilized gaze/attention changing algorithm  

### 3️. **Behavior Engine**
- Defines robot states:  
  - *Idle → Track (Vision + Audio) → Respond → Idle*  
- Locks direction of attention after sound detection  
 

### 4️. **Actuation Layer**
- Arduino + PCA9685  
- Controls:  
  - Neck movement to response the detected audio direction  
  - Eye movement to give attention to engaged talker  
  - Jaw movement to simulate talking
